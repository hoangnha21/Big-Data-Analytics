# Project: Sentiment Analysis of Yelp User Reviews 

## Problem Statemnent

Yelp is one of the most acclaimed and widely used websites as well as mobile-based applications to rate and review businesses online. The vast volumes of data generated by Yelp have enormous potential to create additional revenue. Our project's main purpose is to build a recommender system that would recommend the user to local businesses based on their preference. We are going to predict the sentiment score of the reviews to be able to predict what kind of review the user would give before he hasn’t written the review. We have analyzed the data and based on the analysis made, we found out that out of all the business categories ‘Restaurants’ have a majority count and Philadelphia among all has the highest number of business counts. We expect our recommender systems to suggest restaurants located within the user's local area. We chose ‘Philadelphia’ to be our target location as it has greater entries.

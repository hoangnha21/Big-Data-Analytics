## K-means

### Data

The Iris data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

### Tasks

1.	Import the Iris dataset.
   
1.	Build a K-means model to classify the species of Iris. You can choose a k value randomly at this step.
   
1.	Report the original performance using Silhouette score.
   
1.	Try to improve the performance of the original model by trying at least 10 different k values.
   
1.	Select the best k based on step 4 and print out the following sentence in your code:
â€œk=xx gives the best performance, Silhouette =xx "
(replace xx with your own numbers)
